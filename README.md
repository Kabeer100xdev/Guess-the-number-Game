# 🎯 Number Guessing Game

A fun and interactive number guessing game where players try to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 20.

## 🌟 How the Game Works

1. Enter a number between **1 and 20**.
2. Click the **Check** button to see if your guess is correct.
3. If your guess is wrong, the game provides hints:
   - **📈 Too High** if your guess is above the number.
   - **📉 Too Low** if your guess is below the number.
4. You start with **10 points**, and each incorrect guess decreases your score.
5. If your score reaches **0**, the game ends.
6. If you guess correctly, the background changes to green 🎉.
7. Click the **Again** button to restart the game.
